He's watching the hamster.

among the grass, flowers and berries
he is watching the hamster!
not for a day, not two, but for a whole year
he is watching the hamster!

the hamster is kind, the animal is diligent
looking for grain as always
all day long in worries and affairs
there is no rest for a minute

even if it's raining
it's watching the hamster
even if the heat is standing
it's watching the hamster

The good-natured hamster does not know
that his days are numbered
loves, gets angry and suffers
while he is alive, but! ... 

The animal is carrying food into the hole
and watching the hamster!
he eats and soon grows up
watching the hamster!

more appetizing every day 
food is being prepared for the snake
patience adds to the taste
of a live stash for a snake

the sun warms
the snake's belly, it watches the hamster
it's time to eat, the hamster will mature
it watches the hamster

The day will come and the snake will eat
it will be delicious, but then
in winter
he will warm the toad's belly in the den by the campfire
